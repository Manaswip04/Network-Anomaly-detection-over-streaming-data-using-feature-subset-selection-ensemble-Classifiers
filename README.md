### ABSTRACT
Considering anomaly pattern detection as detecting a point in time where the behavior of the 
system is unusual and significantly different from past behavior. Based on the experimental 
results achieved, we conclude that the proposed technique is an efficient method for network 
intrusion detection. Comparative study shows that the proposed model is efficient than other 
existing models with respect to intrusion detection success rate.
